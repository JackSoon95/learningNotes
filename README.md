# Learning Notes

This repo gathers IT related learning notes recorded by me for future reference. Therefore, I
expect this repo to keep updates always.

The knowledge was gained from different resources, not limited to:

- Videos

- Books

- Articles

***I look forward to hearing from  any recommendations that I can learn and record here!***
